# Real-Estate-Price-Modeling-Using-PCA
A housing price prediction project that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the dataset and improve regression performance. It reduces feature overlap, addresses multicollinearity (overlap between input variables), highlights key variance in the data, and builds a stable linear model for forecasting real estate prices.
